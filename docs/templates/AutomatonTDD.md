This document is to be used as a guideline when creating technical design documents for the Automaton project. Feel free to add or remove section as necessary. Based on this [Design Doc article by Malte Ubl](https://medium.com/@cramforce/design-docs-a-design-doc-a152f4484c6b)

## BACKGROUND, CONTEXT & SCOPE

> The document should first establish the context and scope of the design. This may be done across multiple or a single paragraph. This section should include bullet point lists of “Goals” and “Non-goals” for three reasons:

> It is an efficient way for the reader to establish what the design tries to achieve and what it doesn’t want to achieve.
> It can be used to evaluate whether the detailed design establishes how those goals are achieved.
> It forces the authors to actually make decisions about the scope.

### Goals

### Non-Goals

## OVERVIEW

> Next the document gives an overview of the design. This helps readers gain an understanding of the overall approach, which will make it much easier to evaluate how the details relate to the design. It is important to realize that the design doc should not build up tension when being read from start to the end. Quite the opposite, information is given as fast as possible and the structure should aim to avoid putting related information too far apart.

## DETAILED DESIGN

> This section explains the design, its trade offs and consequences as appropriate. The concrete contents are greatly determined by what is being designed and will vary widely between various types of systems, APIs, front ends, etc. The authors are explicitly empowered to choose a form that best fits their design.

See “Level of detail” below for guidance as to what should determine the contents of the detailed design section.

## CROSS CUTTING CONCERNS

> There may be one or multiple chapters that talk about specific concerns from their specific point of view. While the entire design should have them in mind the dedicated chapters ensure that they are addressed and highlight how the design applies to them. Examples for such concerns are privacy, security, scalability, usability and monitoring.

## ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

This section is a fixed part of the document structure as it forces the authors to think about what alternatives would have been available to achieve the goals of the design. Alternatives may be other possible designs or the use of an existing system that does almost what is needed, the purchase of a standard software or to do nothing at all.

## DOCUMENT HISTORY

> It's a good idea to keep a good history of all participation that took place.
